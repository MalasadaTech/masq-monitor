This API gives direct access to each of the individual API endpoints that are part of combined API calls. 

The Explore API exposes individual endpoints across all our backend systems. 

Implemented as an API gateway in front of existing individual API endpoints.

``https://api.silentpush.com/api/v1/merge-api/``

Sample request:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   https://api.silentpush.com/api/v1/merge-api/explore/domain/domaininfo/silentpush.com

The request must incude an http header in the format:

``X-API-KEY: N98G-YNUT5QFGOFOPEUR0VFED82-PJR...``

The value must be the API key as requested from app.silentpush.com

API Keys are generated by an adminstrative user for your organization in the Organization Settings found in the drop down at the top right hand side of the page.
